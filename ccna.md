# CCNA Notes



## Networking Basics
- What is network?
  - Built to share resources

- Basic Networks
  - Bus Network
    - All devices attach along an ethernet cable
      - i.e. with vampire taps

- Networking Devices
  - Repeater
    - amplified/repeats signal from 1 port to another
    - layer 1
  - Hub
    - a "multi-port repeater"
      - repeated signal from 1 port to all ports
      - layer 1 
  - Switch
    - can read frames and uses MAC address table
    - works at layer 2 but can work at layer 3 if its a managed switch with routing capabilities
    - uses hardware ASICs
  - Bridge
    - intermediate device between switch and hub
    - learned MAC addresses via software
  - Router
    - allows routing between networks
    - layer 3
  - Access Points
    - Can be lightweight or autonomous
  - Wireless Lan Controller
    - Used to manage multiple Acess Points

  - Application
  - Transport
  - Network
  - Data Link
  - Physical
